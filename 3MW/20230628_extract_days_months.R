# compute all time units all at once ----
# the timetk package is a neat package that is especially suited to work with time data. after all, it is designed to help you with time series analysis.
# among the useful functions from this package, you will find one function that takes care of all the previous function calls all at once.

# ah ouais, c'est exhaustif...

# compute only desired time units ----
# based on the timetk function, here's a helper function that let's you actually select which time units you want

## function that extracts only desired time units

  )

# what about non-tibble data? ----
# what if you want to use a vector as input and extract time units from this?
# there is another function tk_get_timeseries_signature() and it works just like you'd expect: you feed it with a vector of dates and it computes all the time units for these dates
